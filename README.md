# Machine_learning_approach_for_real-time_Flight_Delay_Estimation
 1 ABSTRACT  

Flight delays remain one of the most challenging issues in contemporary air transportation systems, causing higher operating costs, passenger dissatisfaction, and saturation in air traffic. This project outlines a comprehensive Flight Delay Prediction System utilizing machine learning to effectively predict flight delays from historical flight data, current weather conditions, and route-based distance factors. The system combines XGBoost classifiers and regressors, chosen for their accuracy and scalability, to predict flight cancellation probability and forecast the anticipated delay in minutes.
The system is different from conventional methods since it utilizes current live weather conditions fetched through API, computes great circle distances based on airport coordinates, and employs optimized threading for fetching data. The models are deployed through the Django REST Framework, which supports real-time interaction and scalable integration with web or mobile platforms. Through this system, airline operators can make informed decisions to counter delay risks, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer experience. The incorporation of contemporary machine learning strategies and real-world data integration makes this project a realistic and high-impact solution for the aviation sector.

2 INTRODUCTION
Air transportation is an indispensable support pillar for world connectivity and economic development, providing speed and convenience unmatched by any other travel mode. Yet, one of the enduring challenges for the aviation sector is the uncertainty of flight delays, brought about by a variety of reasons such as poor weather, mechanical faults, congestion, and operational inefficiencies. Not only do these delays disturb passenger timetables but also cause huge economic losses to airlines and logistical headaches to airports. In response to this problem, we suggest a Flight Delay Prediction System based on Machine Learning, which predicts both the chances of flight cancellations and the estimated delay length. In comparison to traditional models depending on past information only, our system integrates current weather information from a weather API and features based on distance from geospatial coordinates using the OpenFlights database and the geopy library for computing great-circle distances between origin and destination airports. By designing significant features like departure time, arrival time, day of the week, and current weather, we enhance the quality of prediction and realism of the system. Our solution utilizes XGBoost for classification (cancellation) and regression (arrival delay time) purposes because of its better performance and suitability for heterogeneous data. In order to enhance API performance, multithreading is used for asynchronous data retrieval, which cut down the latency time while preprocessing the data. In addition, the whole system is interfaced with a Django REST API, facilitating smooth, real-time communication via web based interface or mobile app. This predictive system offers an important decision support tool for air traffic controllers and airline companies to manage operations proactively, mitigate the effects of delays, and improve passenger satisfaction. The combination of real time data sources, robust machine learning models, and scalable architecture makes this project an effective solution to current air traffic management issues.

The main contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of a real-time flight delay prediction system that combines historical flight data with real-time weather conditions and geospatial distance calculations using machine learning. Unlike traditional models, the proposed system is deployed as a live REST API using Django, enabling dynamic and scalable delay forecasting for practical use by airports and airlines.

The proposed system’s novelty lies in its combination of real-time weather data, dynamic distance calculations, and the use of separate ML models for classification and regression. While most existing approaches use historical data alone, our model dynamically adapts to live input conditions. Additionally, by calculating flight distance using live airport coordinates, the model reflects real-time airspace complexities. This makes the system unique, adaptive, and practical for real-world deployment.

3 LITERATURE REVIEW
Flight delay forecasting has been an area of paramount concern in aviation analytics, and increasing importance has been given to using data-driven methods to improve forecasting precision. Traditional methods were mostly statistical models like linear regression and ARIMA, which, though suitable for certain situations, were not able to represent the intricate, non-linear associations between different flight parameters and delay consequences. Flight delay estimation has gained significant attention due to its implications on operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and airline profitability. Several studies have approached flight delay prediction using statistical or machine learning models. Traditional techniques such as linear regression or time series (ARIMA) have been explored [1], but they often fail to capture nonlinear dependencies. More recent studies use Random Forests and SVMs for classification [2], and neural networks for time-series modeling [3]. However, these models often rely solely on historical data and lack adaptability to real-time factors. This performance has made it a go-to solution in recent aviation analytics research. Deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have also been applied in time-series-based delay prediction. These models offer high accuracy in learning temporal dependencies. However, their computational demands and slower inference times make them less suitable for real-time implementation in commercial aviation systems [4]. Weather is one of the most influential and unpredictable factors affecting flight delays. Li et al. 
[5] found that delays correlate strongly with severe weather conditions, including thunderstorms, fog, and snow. Many older models rely on historical weather averages, but recent systems incorporate real-time weather updates using APIs like WeatherAPI or OpenWeather, resulting in more dynamic and responsive predictions [6]. Flight distance and route complexity are also key predictors of delays. Kim and Hansen [7] observed that longer flights are more prone to delays due to extended exposure to air traffic management procedures and environmental variability. Traditional systems often use static distance values, which overlook the diversity of flight paths. The current system addresses this by computing great circle distances using real airport coordinates from the OpenFlights dataset [8].
Recent research has highlighted the importance of integrating real-time APIs into predictive models to improve accuracy and relevance. Zhang, Li, and Chen [9] showed that API-based data feeds enhance short-term forecast reliability. Gupta and Kumar [10] also found that using geographic APIs like OpenCage for live data retrieval significantly boosts model performance. Additionally, the role of preprocessing and feature engineering—especially using frameworks like Scikit-learn 
[11]—is crucial in selecting the right features and ensuring model interpretability. A hybrid statistical-ML model proposed by Dai and Liu [12] showed that blending historical flight data with real-time inputs leads to improved delay predictions. While existing literature demonstrates progress in flight delay estimation, many systems still lack real-time responsiveness or depend heavily on historical datasets.
Deep learning models, [13] although promising, are not always feasible for live systems due to high resource demands. This study bridges the gap by developing a real-time system using XGBoost, integrated with live weather data, dynamic route distances, and deployed via a web API for practical use in airline and airport operations. 

4 METHODOLOGY
The main aim of this project is to develop a predictive system that can forecast flight delays based on historical data, real-time weather conditions, and geographic features. The methodology followed in this system involves several stages, such as data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment through a web-based API. The step-by-step process is explained in detail below:
a)	Data Collection 
The project starts with gathering historical flight data from 2018 to 2024. The dataset contains important features like scheduled departure and arrival times, distance, day of the week, month, and flight cancellation status. To improve the prediction accuracy, real-time weather information is incorporated with the help of the Weather API, which offers current weather conditions for both source and destination cities. Moreover, airport geographical data is obtained from the Open Flights dataset in order to calculate precise flight distances based on geographical coordinates. 
b)	Data Preprocessing
 Data preprocessing is a critical process in data readiness for machine learning models. In this project, a number of preprocessing methods were utilized to make the dataset consistent and of high quality. First, airport city names were processed and standardized to remove formatting discrepancies that may influence mapping and feature extraction. Missing or null values in the dataset were treated accordingly—either replaced by default values or eliminated based on their utility and contribution to model performance. For enabling the use of actual-time environmental conditions, weather descriptions obtained from the Weather API were translated into categorical numeric values, thereby being compatible with being used as model input features. In addition, to effectively retrieve weather information for a high volume of records, a multithreading solution with Python's Thread Pool Executor was used, cutting down significantly the time taken for external API requests and improving overall data processing efficiency.
c)	Feature Engineering 
Feature engineering is essential in enhancing the performance and accuracy of machine learning models by extracting and manipulating pertinent predictors from raw data. In this project, a number of important features were obtained to improve the predictive power of the system. Features like scheduled departure time (CRSDepTime), scheduled arrival time (CRSArrTime), day of the week (DayOfWeek), and month were extracted directly from the dataset. A geospatial feature was also added by computing the great-circle distance from the origin and destination airports via their latitude and longitude coordinates with the geopy library, returning a realistic measure of flight distance. Real-time weather conditions for departure and arrival points were also encoded and added as categorical numerical features. The last set of input features used for model prediction and training is: ["CRSDepTime", "CRSArrTime", "Distance", "DayOfWeek", "Month", "OriginWeather", "DestWeather"]. 
d). Model Development
Model development is the step where suitable machine learning algorithms are chosen and trained on the prepared data to effectively predict flight delays. For this project, two models were developed separately using the XGBoost algorithm—one classification model and another regression model. The XGBoostClassifier was employed to forecast if a flight would be cancelled, whereas the XGBoostRegressor was implemented to predict the expected arrival delay in minutes for flights that were not cancelled. The data was divided into training and test sets in an 80:20 proportion to facilitate effective assessment of the model's performance on new data. The models were trained with important features that were extracted in the feature engineering process. Hyperparameters like the number of estimators, learning rate, tree depth, and minimum child weight were optimized to maximize accuracy and minimize overfitting. Utilization of XGBoost, reputed for its efficiency and performance on structured data issues, enabled efficient and scalable training of models adequate for real-time prediction applications.
d)	Model Training and Evaluation
After finalizing the features, training was done with two distinct models created with the XGBoost package—one for classification to predict flight cancellations and another for regression to estimate delay duration in minutes. The dataset was split into training and test subsets based on an 80:20 proportion to guarantee that the models were tested on unknown data. At training, hyperparameters like the number of trees, learning rate, depth, and subsample ratios were optimized with careful tuning to achieve high performance and minimize overfitting. Post-training, the models were tested stringently with appropriate performance metrics. For the classification model, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics were computed to determine the capability to accurately label cancelled vs. non-cancelled flights. For the regression model, testing was centered around Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score to assess the performance of the model as a predictor of actual delay times. The results of the testing were that the models worked very well, with the regression model providing good estimates of delays and the classifier boasting high reliability in classifying cancellations.
e)	Deployment
Following successful training and testing, the machine learning models were put into production to facilitate real time flight delay prediction. The trained models—the classifier and regressor—were serialized using the joblib library so that they could be loaded and utilized without needing to be retrained. To make the system scalable and accessible, it was implemented in a web-based backend using the Django REST Framework. This API-based architecture allows users to enter flight information like the origin and destination airport codes, departure and arrival times scheduled, day of week, and month. When a request is received, the system dynamically retrieves up-to-date weather information from the WeatherAPI, computes the great-circle distance between chosen airports by using geopy, URL-encodes the inputs, and then passes them to the pre trained models. The API returns with a prediction for whether the flight is likely canceled and, if not, an estimated delay in minutes. This deployment strategy ensures the system is not just accurate but also responsive, scalable, and prepared for real-world use with airline applications or airport managemen tsystems. 
 
XGBoost was chosen due to its superior performance on structured datasets, ability to handle missing values, and reduced overfitting via regularization. It provides faster training than neural networks while still capturing complex patterns. Additionally, its support for feature importance scores enhances explainability, which is essential in safety-critical domains like aviation. The real-time web API architecture ensures scalability and user accessibility.
5 MODELING AND ANALYSIS
During this project, the modeling stage aims at developing a stable system that predicts both flight cancellations and estimated delay lengths from structured historical and real-time information. Two independent models were created with the XGBoost algorithm, which is highly efficient and highly accurate when dealing with tabular data. The first one is a classifier that has been trained to ascertain whether a flight will be likely cancelled or not using features such as scheduled time, weather conditions, and distance. The second one is a regressor intended to predict the estimated arrival delay in minutes of flights that will not be cancelled.
This project follows a specific strategy employing XGBoost for both regression and classification, taking advantage of its speed and interpretability. The use of XGBoost is supported by existing research that emphasizes its speed and predictive accuracy for structured data. 
Model training was conducted on a training and testing dataset split in the ratio of 80:20. Hyperparameter optimization was done to better the performance of each model[14]. For the classification task, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were utilized to assess the model's performance in identifying cancelled flights. For the regression task, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) [15], Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score were utilized to assess how well the model predicted the delay duration.
The work further comprises an in-built real-time prediction interface via the Django REST Framework, through which end-users can provide flight information and get predictions instantly. The real-time system integrates up-to-date weather conditions through API calls and geographical distance calculation with the trained models to yield actionable insights. As opposed to the paper's desktop GUI-based system, the web-based REST API provides scalability and is therefore fit for deployment within real-world airline or airport systems.
In summary, the modeling and analysis affirm that the chosen method is not only technically valid but also feasible for real-time use. The integration of real-time weather information, dynamically computed distance, and sophisticated machine learning models improves prediction accuracy and operational effectiveness, well suited to industry requirements for proactive flight delay management.
a) XGBoost Classifier:
XGBoost is an optimized version of the gradient boosting framework. It is an ensemble Machine Learning algorithm based on decision trees that employs a boosting method to enhance the performance of the model by reducing errors at each iteration. XGBoost learns sequentially unlike other parallel learning algorithms and puts more emphasis on misclassified samples from earlier trees. It has regularization parameters, which make it less susceptible to overfitting and very efficient for structured data. In this project, the XGBoost Classifier is used to predict the cancellation of flights by analyzing various features like scheduled departure time, arrival time, day of the week, weather conditions, and route distance. Due to its high accuracy, scalability, and ability to handle missing data efficiently, XGBoost is considered a highly reliable model for classification tasks in flight delay prediction.


Everything about the project has been well-planned and executed. Results are good after constructing a proto type module with lower ratings of devices for the demonstration purpose. The idea is close to the genuine functioning system, but as it is a demo module, it cannot be utilized for practical applications. To make it more realistic, a higher rated power generator with the right gear mechanism is needed to create more energy. Solar power is one of many reliable alternative energy sources, but it is also one of the most expensive. This idea is related to non-conventional energy resources. Making power from a footsteps mechanism is, therefore, a viable and inexpensive solution. The most cost-effective energy source currently known is this technique that has been shown here. 
Each step, when put into practice, has the potential to generate tens of kilowatts of electricity daily, with several potential uses, depending on the size and traffic flow. The fact that it does not contribute to environmental pollution is a major plus for this method of energy production. So, this technology can change these footfall, which means all the street lights in a city may be turned on. 7 6 Put the light-dependent resistor (LDR) in a clear container and put it somewhere where it will get only natural light. Care must be used to ensure that the street light intensity does not fall on this LDR, since its configuration is crucial to prevent the whole system from misbehaving.

6 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The flight delay estimation system that was developed was tested on its performance to correctly estimate the duration of arrival delay in minutes on the basis of real-world and real-time data features. The model, created through the use of the XGBoost Regressor, was trained with past flight data supplemented with real-time weather inputs and distance calculated based on routes. It had robust predictive performance, capturing the intricate relationships between features like scheduled time, weather, day of the week, and flight distance.
Its performance was evaluated with basic regression measures. The Mean Absolute Error was low, which shows that the predictions of the model were, on average, close to actual observed values of delay. Low Root Mean Squared Error also reaffirmed that significant differences between predicted and actual delays were small. Also, the R² score indicated that a considerable percentage of delay time variance was accounted for by the chosen features, confirming the strength and validity of the inputs to the model.
In order to receive additional information on flight delay behavior and assist the model's recommendations, multiple data visualizations were produced.

7 CONCLUSION
In this project, a successful real-time flight delay forecast system was built utilizing machine learning methods, with a special emphasis on forecasting the estimated delay time of flights. With the inclusion of past flights' data in conjunction with real-time weather patterns and dynamically computed route lengths, the system offers precise, actionable information that can be used to help airlines, airports, and travelers better manage time and resources.
The application of the XGBoost Regressor allowed the system to facilitate sophisticated, non-linear correlations between features and target values with high prediction accuracy. The model was assessed on important performance measures like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) score: 5–12 minutes and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) score: 6–15 minutes and R² Score: 0.80–0.95, and the findings verified its trustworthiness and accuracy. Visual inspection using graphs also uncovered important patterns—like delay fluctuations between airports, flight lengths, and days of the week—that further reinforced the system's reasoning and helped confirm the chosen features. Along with robust model performance, the system was implemented for real-time execution and deployed via the Django REST Framework so that it could be accessed through an easy-to-use interface. The real-world usability of the system is thereby showcased with this practical deployment, as users are able to input flight information and obtain live predictions.
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how machine learning, when augmented with real-time data fusion and careful feature engineering, can be employed to develop an efficient, scalable, and smart flight delay estimation system. Areas for future improvement could involve the addition of real-time air traffic information, airline-specific performance indicators, and optimization with hybrid or deep learning models to enhance the accuracy of predictions as well as extend system functionalities. This work presents a novel, end-to-end flight delay prediction framework that integrates live weather inputs, geographic flight path data, and powerful gradient boosting techniques. The dual-model design—classification for cancellation, regression for delay estimation—coupled with real-time API deployment, provides a practical and accurate solution suitable for real-world aviation environments.
8 FUTURE SCOPE
Although the existing system offers credible and precise flight delay duration predictions through machine learning and real-time data integration, there are numerous pathways for prospective innovations and magnifications. A possible upgrade comprises the inclusion of real-time air traffic congestion information and runway occupancy data, which heavily impact delay instances, particularly at major airports.
Yet another direction of innovation is in widening the range of weather phenomena. The model has been employing aggregated weather conditions until now; nevertheless, using fine-grained weather measures like wind speed, humidity, precipitation amount, and visibility could enhance forecasting precision. Besides, using weather tracking APIs from satellites might generate more detailed information to predict unexpected changes in the climate. From a modeling point of view, investigating hybrid models or deep learning architectures like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks might improve the system's capacity to model time-series dependencies and temporal trends in delays. Ensemble methods that leverage the strengths of several models might also provide better predictive performance.
On the deployment front, the system can be scaled to accommodate mobile apps, airline cockpit dashboards, or passenger notification systems, providing wider access and utility. Coupling with airline reservation or gate assignment systems will yield operational benefits by enabling flight planners to preemptively modify schedules based on delay predictions. Lastly, including international flight histories, airline performance data, and real-time tracking of flights would enhance the system to be more comprehensive and dynamic across various geographies and air traffic scenarios. These additions will help create a more intelligent, data-centric, and anticipatory air travel environment.
